Bar Napkin - iphone app prototype
=================================

API - http://bn.ztest.ekingery.com

### What?

This is a prototype put together as a learning experience for iphone development

The app_engine_api directory contains the python source for the app engine API. The API uses the [geomodel library](http://code.google.com/p/geomodel/) and the app engine python data store. The API will return the 10 closest venues to the parameter coordinates.

The iphone directory contains an iphone app which will detect the user's geo coordinates, make a call to the API, and display the 10 closest venues from the venues DB.
